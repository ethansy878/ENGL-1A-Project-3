        <p>For many of us, we use social media every day. With billions of registered users across thousands of different apps, it has become an integral part of many people's life.</p>
        <p>Much of social media can be split into two types: open media and closed media.</p>
        <p>In this web experience, you'll join Ethan in taking a deep dive into each type of social media. You'll see how each app works through the lens of his two favorite apps, both of which represent their respective categories quite well.</p>
        <p>Along the way, there will be opportunities for your own input and visuals to guide you through the exploration. The tour starts below!</p>
