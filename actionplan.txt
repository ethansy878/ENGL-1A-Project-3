Idea: Website for Project 2 - Technology Analysis for Middle/High Schoolers

Main page - main ideas, big font, images, graphics

Each argument - its own page, series of text boxes, images, interactivity, etc.
Make use of any artistic ideas - sound FX, moving elements, and more!
Can get a little weird with it if you're going for secondary schoolers as audience.

Nav bar at the top for those that like to jump around.
Links at the bottom of each page for those who want to progress linearly.

Make it look good, but no need to go over the top! Cozy feel, good font, nice colors.
