Idea: Website for Project 2 - Technology Analysis for Middle/High Schoolers

INDEX.HTML - Main page, has the main ideas, big fonts, images, graphics.
This is a FRONT PAGE not the intro page yet.

Then start with an intro page that introduces the Ethan the "tour guide". It will be in text message format, along with the rest of the pages. Here, tell users about me (can use a visual), initialize preferred theme, and link to 1st argument page. After, refer to essay for arguments and evidence.

Each paragraph from the essay is its own page. Explain the argument using a series of not-too-long text boxes ("messages"), images, user prompts (Genshin pick-from-choice style + others for fun), etc.
Make use of any artistic ideas - sound FX [https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/dom_obj_audio.asp], moving elements [https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_transitions.asp], and more!
You can get a little weird with it if you're going for secondary schoolers as audience.

Use the mouse to navigate and activate certain things. Program it so you have to go in order. And maybe have a FFW button for the impatient ones.

Have a nav bar at the top for those that like to jump around. Appears after the title/section header vanishes.
Links at the bottom of each page for those who want to progress linearly.

Make it look good, but no need to go over the top! Cozy feel, good font, nice colors.
