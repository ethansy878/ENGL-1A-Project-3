        <p>There are two fundamental issues with Instagram I want to address here.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="nar">
        <p>First, their algorithms. These things completely govern what we see on our front pages, often times through ways we don't expect.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="nar finisher">
        <p>To demonstrate, let's consider a scenario. Suppose your friend asks you about one of the following topics, you enter it into your search bar, and you hit search:</p>

        <p>Well, that's the algorithm at work. I was explaining that before I was rudely interrupted.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="nar finisher">
        <p>The algorithm thought that ad was relevant to you based on your search. It also predicted that you would interact with it even if it wasn't what you wanted in the moment.</p>

        <p>I have personally experienced a scenario in my Instagram feed where an ad, just like the one you saw, took the place of my friend's post. They purposely threw me out of the loop!</p>

        <p>Ads and the algorithm are annoying, there's no doubt about it. But there is another problem here that is far worse.</p>
