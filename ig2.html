        <p>First, their algorithms. These things completely govern what we see on our front pages, often times in ways we don't expect.</p>

        <p>To demonstrate, let's consider a scenario. Suppose your friend asks you about one of the following topics, you enter it into your search bar, and you hit search:</p>
