        <p>To explain, let me quickly introduce an app called Slack. <br> <img src="/images/placeholder.png"></p>
    </div>
    <div class="nar">
        <p>They make an app similar to Discord, but geared for workplaces.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="nar">
        <p>What matters, though, is their design philosophy. The company “asks designers to close their eyes and imagine what a person might have experienced in their life before sitting down at their desk” (Wachter-Boettcher 190).</p>
    </div>
    <div class="nar">
        <p>In other words, they want developers to design with the user in mind.</p>

        <p>Discord changed their logo and branding a couple years ago. This was when they doubled down on improving the user experience.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="nar">
        <p>They created or improved several crucial functions, including:
            <ul>
                <li>Notification settings</li>
                <li>Reasonable, optional premium services - "Nitro" and "Server Boosts"</li>
                <li>Strong administrative tools for community servers</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="nar">
        <p>You could tell they wanted to make users happy. And it worked.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="nar">
        <p>Into the lockdown, Discord was able to be a cozy, online home for millions of teenagers.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="nar">
        <p>There were no tricks. People used Discord for its purpose. They had the freedom to decide their time spent online, and it was very much possible to be a healthy user there.</p>

    <div class="nar finish">
        <p>What did Discord get in return? <br> <img src="images/placeholder.png"> (A massive boost in relelvance and revenue. That's a win!) </p>
