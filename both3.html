        <p>To explain, let me quickly introduce an app called Slack. <br> <img src="/images/slack-logo.png"></p>

        <p>They make an app similar to Discord, but geared for workplaces.</p>

    <div class="item nar">
        <p>What matters, though, is their design philosophy. The company “asks designers to close their eyes and imagine what a person might have experienced in their life before sitting down at their desk” (Wachter-Boettcher 190).</p>

        <p>In other words, they want developers to design with the user in mind.</p>

        <p>Discord changed their logo and branding a couple years ago. This was when they doubled down on improving the user experience.</p>

    <div class="item nar">
        <p>They created or improved several crucial functions, including:
            <ul>
                <li>Notification settings</li>
                <li>Reasonable, optional premium services like "Nitro" and "Server Boosts"</li>
